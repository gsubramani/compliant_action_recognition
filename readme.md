Compliant Action Recognition
============================
1. TODOS:
* check compliant_action_recognition.py

ALL THE FILES HAVE CHANGED!
---------------------------


1. compliant_action_recognition.py
* contains classes that incorporate training of models with labeled data
as an input format. To replace the following files.



Files used for training models:

1. LSTM_only_training.py
* Training pure LSTM model
* Please look at the file to determine the parameters of the model

1. LSTM_wavelet_training.py
* LSTM model + with wavelet transformations

1. wavelet_training.py
* Pure wavelet transformation



Note: Training data is contained in "grab_objects_sig.pdl"
Will need to change this for future use

TODO: Create a training library to import
